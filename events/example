# This is an example event handler script
#
# Event handlers have to have the same name as the sensor they are handling
# you can list the sensor names (and read their current value) of the default
# SANE device using the -L flag, example:
#
# % ./insaned -L
# List of sensors for device 'genesys:libusb:001:003':
#     copy        [no]
#     email       [no]
#     extra       [no]
#     file        [no]
#     scan        [no]
#
# If you want to use another device, you can specify the device name using the
# -d flag. You can list the available devices using insaned -h or scanimage -L
# Currently, no authorization is supported.
#
# Event handlers have to be executable. The daemon will log warnings if you press
# a button for which it cannot find a corresponding event handler.
# If you want to suppress these warnings, create an empty executable handler script.
# E.g. like this:
#
# touch /etc/insaned/events/copy
# chmod 755 /etc/insaned/events/copy
#
# Insaned passes the device name to event scripts as the first parameter (i.e. "$1"),
# for the case that you have multiple scanners

# it is always good to use variables to have quick access to varios settings
TMPFILE="/tmp/scan.tiff"
# required (see usage below)
LOCKFILE="/tmp/insaned-scan.lock"

# each event script should start with such check
# it ensures that only one event script is executed at time, so that they do not disturb each other
# make sure to remove the lock file at the end of script
if [ -f "$LOCKFILE" ]; then
  echo "Error: Another scanning operation is currently in progress"
  exit 0
fi
touch "$LOCKFILE"

# always clean up stale temporary files at the beginning of the script
rm -f "$TMPFILE"

# 
# put your custom content here
#


#
# examples:
#

# shamelessly stolen from scanbuttond
#
# This example turns your scanner+printer into a photocopier.
# Fine-tuned for the Epson Perfection 2400, the HP LaserJet 1200 and
# ISO A4 paper size so that the scanned document matches the printer
# output as closely as possible.
#
# scanimage --device-name "$1" --format tiff --mode Gray --quick-format A4 \
# --resolution 300 --sharpness 0 --brightness -3 \
# --gamma-correction "High contrast printing" > "$TMPFILE"
# tiff2ps -z -w 8.27 -h 11.69 "$TMPFILE" | lpr


# This example starts gwenview if it is not already started
# 
# if ! ps aux | /bin/egrep -wq 'gwen[v]iew' ; then
#     gwenview >/dev/null 2>&1 &
# fi


# each event script should end with removing the lock file
rm -f "$LOCKFILE"
